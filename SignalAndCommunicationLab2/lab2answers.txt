* main calls signal and sets the SIGINT signal to be handled by sigHandler instead of the default handler
* main then calls printf, which prints "waiting... \n"
* it then pauses

* when you hit ctrl-c, it sends the SIGINT signal, which is the sent to sigHandler
* sigHandler calls printf, which prints "received an interrupt signal through Ctrl-C.\n
* it then calls printf again, which prints "Going to sleep.\n Notice the process is not exiting immediately"
* it then sleeps for 1 second
* after the sleep it prints "Out of here.\n", followed by "Now the process will terminate with the exit system call \n"
* it then calls exit(0) which closes the program
